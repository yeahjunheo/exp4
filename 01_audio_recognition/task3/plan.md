From the basic sample provided to us, I need to add more features to make it more like a karaoke machine.

I'll have a list of songs to select, in my case i'll just add two (twinkle twinkle little star and old macdonald)

Lyrics will be displayed on the screen and pitch/echo/tremolo will be added on the side

From the main app I'll separate it into left and right.

LEFT:
spectrogram for audio
lyrics separate appropriately and highlighted according to time


RIGHT:
pitch and volume for background music
echo and volume for input audio

After the song is done, display the final score... dunno

Score should
