# 共分散行列が対角行列であるときと，そうでないときのそれぞれについて，どのような多次元正規分布を仮定しているのかについて説明せよ．

## Explain the assumptions made regarding multivariate normal distribution in two cases: When the covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix, and hen the covariance matrix is not a diagonal matrix.

Whtn the covariance matrix is a diagonal, all elements are independent of each other, therefore there is no correlation between each element in a multivariate normal distribution. One the other hand, a non-diagonal matrix cannot insure that all elements are independent. Therefore, there might be some correlation between each element in a multivariate normal distribution. 

Assume we take a 2x2 matrix. If we were to draw the overall possible shapes of a diagonal and a non-diagonal matrix, the diagonal will stretch along the x-axis or the y-axis. Never diagonally. On the other hand, the non-diagonal will stretch and skew towards any direction because correlation between two elements exists.
